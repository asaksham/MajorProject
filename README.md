a ∼ 0.02 1 ms determines the time scale of the recovery variable u. The larger the value of a, the quicker the recovery. 
• b ∼ 0.20[dimensionless] describes the sensitivity of the recovery variable uto the sub-threshold fluctuations of the membrane potential v. Larger values of b couple u and v more strongly, resulting in possible sub-threshold oscillations and low-threshold spiking dynamics. 
• c ∼ −65mV gives the after-spike reset value of the membrane potential vcaused by the fast high-threshold K+conductances. 
• d ∼ 6mV describes the after-spike reset of the recovery variable ucaused by slow high-threshold Na+and K+conductances.
